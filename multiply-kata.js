/* Multiplication */

// Create 2 variables, a & b, and set to ne random integers between 3 and 9
// Set a variable called equation to display  a * b = ??
var equation = 0;
for (let question = 0; question < 5; question++) {
    var a = Math.floor(Math.random()*(10-3))+3;
    var b = Math.floor(Math.random()*(10-3))+3;
// Set a variable called product to be the product of a and b
    var product = a * b;
equation = alert(a + " * " + b + " = ??");
// Ask the equation of the user and store the user input in a variable called answer
answer = prompt(equation);
if (answer == product) alert("Correct!");
else alert("Incorrect!");
}
// Say "Correct!" if the answer and product match, "Incorrect!" if not.
/* Multiplication whjile Loop */
// Embed all this code in a While loop and run it 5 times.

/* Multiplication For Loop */
// Convert the while loop to a for loop.
